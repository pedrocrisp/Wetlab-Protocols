# PARE-Truseq Library Preps v2.0

Adapter from *[German et. al., 2009](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n3/full/nprot.2009.8.html)* and *[Zhai et. al., 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202313002375)*.

## Prepare >75 ug total RNA
Extract total RNA using TRIzol or other RNA extraction method. 
- Run RNA on GXII to check quality, RIN >7.
- Prepare RNA: use 75ug of total RNA as starting material. Adjust volume of 75ug total RNA to 100ul with DEPC-treated water. 

## mRNA Purification
Purify mRNA using Invitrogen Dynabeads mRNA direct kit: 

### Prepare beads:
- Transfer 200ul of Dynabeads in a 1.5ml tube on magnetic for 30sec and then pipette off the supernatant. 
- Remove tube from stand, resuspend in 100ul Binding Buffer to calibrate beads, place on magnet and aspirate.
- Remove tube from stand, resuspend in 100ul Binding Buffer (optimal hybridization conditions are a 1:1 ratio relative to sample volume).

### Denature RNA:
- Heat to 65<sup>o</sup>C for 2 min to disrupt secondary structures. Place on ice for 5 mins. 

### Isolate mRNA
- Add the total RNA to the Dynabeads/Binding Buffer suspension and mix thoroughly with pipette.
-  Rotate on a roller or mixer for 5 min at RT to allow the mRNA to anneal to the oligo (dT)25 on the beads using program F3 15 RPM. 
- Place the tube on the magnetic stand until the solution is clear and remove the supernatant. 
- Remove the tube from the stand and wash the mRNA- bead complex TWICE with 200ul Washing Buffer B. Remove all the supernatant between each washing step with the help of the magnetic stand. 
- Elute the mRNA from the beads by adding 16ul of Elution Buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). 
- Place tube at 65<sup>o</sup>C for 2 min and then place immediately on the magnetic stand. Transfer 15ul of the eluted mRNA to a new tube. 
- Optional: recover another 1ul of purified mRNA and run on GXII

### Wash Dynabeads:
- Wash dynabeads in 100ul of bind buffer, then store in 100 ul bind buffer for re-use to purify the 5’ (ensure the beads are re-used for the same sample the second time).

### AMPure XP (1.8x) size selecton of cDNA reaction:
AMPure clean the short (7 cycle) PCR.

Add the following to a new non-stick, nuclease-free 0.2 ml PCR tube, strip or plate:

|Reagent			|volume	|
|:------------------------------|:------:|
|AMPure XP bead solution	|90 μl	|
|cDNA Reaction          	|50 μl	|

- Vigorously vortex tube and incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- Place tube in magnetic stand for 5 minutes or until solution clears, to capture the beads. After the suspension is clear, remove and discard supernatant. Do not disturb bead pellet.
- With the tube on the magnetic stand, carefully add 180 μl of 80% EtOH to the bead pellet.
- Lift the tube off the magnetic stand, move it up one row and place it back onto the magnetic stand. Repeat 6 times. Allow the beads to settle. Discard the supernatant.
- With the tube on the magnetic stand, repeat the wash with 180 μl of 80% EtOH. Discard the supernatant. Do not disturb the beads. 
- Open the tube lid and transfer to a 37°C heat block for 3 minutes or until the beads are completely dry. Small cracks can be observed in the dried pellet.
- Add 16.8 μl of dH<sub>2</sub>O directly to the pellet and mix thoroughly using a pipette. 
- Incubate for 10 minutes.
- Place the tube in the magnetic stand for at least 2 minute to allow complete capture of the beads. When suspension is clear, transfer 15.8 ul of the library-containing supernatant to a new tube.

	Optional stopping point – store at -20°C
 
## Mme1 Digestion 
Note: Mme1 will begin cleaving on ice and at 50°C

|Reagent			|volume	|___x|
|:------------------------------|:------:|:--:|
|Purified PCR Product 	|15.8ul|--|
|10X NEB4 Buffer		      |2ul ||
|10X SAM (32mM) 		   |0.2ul||

- Remove from 37°C, heat kill at 65°C for 20min
- Let cool at RT (do NOT place on ice); 
- Prepare Duplex Adapter during heat kill step. 

## Ligation of 3’-double-strand DNA Adapter

Make freshly prepared duplex adaptor by annealing 20% more oligo than needed (so that there is enough for the ligation master mix), eg for 9 samples use 11ul of each:

|Reagent			|volume	|
|:------------------------------|:------:|
|dsDNA_2_Top |	1ul |
|dsDNA_2_Bottom	|1ul|
|TOTAL 	|	2ul|

- 100°C(5min); 
- Slow cool down to RT by stepping temp down 5°C every 30sec (0.1°C /s to 25°C).  (~18min cycle)
- Keep at RT. 

## Set up duplex ligation:

|Reagent			|volume	|___x|
|:------------------------------|:------|:--:|
|Mme1 digested PCR |			20ul |--|
|Annealed Duplex Adaptor (100uM) |		2ul ||

## PAGE purify ds-DNA adapter ligation

The dsDNA adapter can form dimers and; subsequently, the ssDNA adapters once denatured can prime the final PCR if not removed, which results in spurious adapter dimers dominating the final library. Using an adapter without the 5'phosphate may reduce dimer formation; however, this may also impact ligation efficiency for the desired insert.

Samples are not yet indexed therefore preferably leave spaces between samples, and run sample groups on different gels (i.e. only replicates on the same gel).

### 12 % native PAGE (0.5x TBE)
- 1.5ml spacers (or 1.0mm and will have leftovers), 2 gels

|	|2x 1.5mm gels (4x 1.0 mm gels)	|4 x 1.5 mm gels|
|:-------|:--------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|40% acrylamide (acryl: bis 1:19)	| 9.0 ml |	15.0 ml |
|10 x TBE	|1.5 ml|	2.5 ml|
|dH<sub>2</sub>O	|up to 30ml	|up to 50ml|
|*Optional 0.22uM filter, add then quickly pour:* | | |		
|10% APS (100mg/ml H<sub>2</sub>0)	|210ul	|350ul|
|TEMED|	21|	35ul|


- Add 5x Biorad loading dye (GLB) to samples, max volume is 25 ul for 1.0mm gel

#### Run Gel:

- 180 V
- ~50 mins until bromo blue just above bottom of gel
- Add 73 bp marker (5 ul) (ELIP2 is PCR product) Not needed really
- Add 0.25ug Invitrogen 10bp ladder (0.25ul into 5 ul H<sub>2</sub>O + 2ul GLB) 

#### Stain Gel:

- Stain 5 mins in 100ml H<sub>2</sub>O + 10ul EtBr (final – 1mg/ml), rinse twice in MQ H<sub>2</sub>O
Cut bands:
- Align sterile razor with the 60 and 70 bp markers and cut to capture the band corresponding to the ligation product (63bp); avoid adapter dimers (44bp) and place slices in shredder tubes.


### Gel Purification of ligation:

#### Assemble gel shredder tubes: 

- Make 3 small holes in the bottom of a 0.5ml tube with a fine gauge syringe (eg 25 G - 0.5mm), large gauges with make it hard to pipette gel debris later.
- Place shredder in 2ml low bind tube (2ml for better mixing of debris)

#### Shred:

- Add gel slice and spin at max rcf for 2 mins, 
  - After spin small debris that get stuck in shredder can be tapped out into collection tube.
- Add 450 ul DEPC H<sub>2</sub>O

---
- Elute DNA overnight at 4°C by rotating on the inteli mixer F5 60 RPM
- Pre-chill 100% ethanol at -20°C for next day

---

#### Precipitate and recover DNA:
*Put 100% ethanol in the -80°C to 10 mins if you forgot yesterday…*
- Add gel debris slurry to Spin-X 0.45 uM spin filter, and spin 2 mins max speed 4°C
- Keep flow-through and add:
  * 2 ul Glycoblue
  * 46 ul NaOAc (4M)
  * 1400 ul  EtOH (pre-chilled)
- Invert 11 times
- Spin 20,000 RCF x 20 mins at 4°C, then aspirate supernatant 
- Wash with 500ul of 70% ethanol at RT, spin 2 mins 7,000 RCF and aspirate ethanol
  * Pulse spin again and aspirate with fine tip if necessary to remove trace ethanol 
- Dry for 5-10 mins at 37°C
- Re-suspend in 31ul of 10mM Tris pH 8.5

 
## Pilot PCR – ½ reactions

Use 14 ul from 2 or more samples, but not all samples to test PCR:
Use 14 ul of the ligation to determine the optimal number of PCR cycles needed to amplify library to around 10-20nM (need at least 2nM after PCR clean-up for clustering). Use a couple of samples e.g. one of each replicate group (not all samples in case further optimization is needed).  Start with 10-15 cycles, which should be sufficient (less for RNA decay mutants), use the PAGE purification of the ligation as a guide, if the ligation band was visible, 10 cycles should suffice. 

Note: Ideally, all samples should be amplified on the same machine at the same time with the same cycle number once optimization is complete.

^Note that this is 4x conc in the Truseq-PARE protocol I was sent from Blake’s lab (0.1um); but it seemed low so I increased it.  German et al Nat Biotec used 0.5 uM in the original published protocol.
**The Illumina support site reports that any index combination shows minimal variability, including low-plex pools.

Run 2 ul on GXII HS-DNA chip. 

## Final PCR
Repeat PCR conditions as per pilot with optimized cycle number. 

## AMPure XP (1.7x) purify and concentrate final library
*Note: original protocol used 6% native PAGE at this step, beads work great and are much more convinent*

AMPure purify PCR as previously. Can pool either beofre or after AMPure step.  Note that it is reccommended that each batch of AMPure XP beads are tested to calibrate the sweet spot to recover the 128bp library while avoiding any adapter dimers that may appear at around 80bp and below, for this batch 1.7x recovered 60% of the 130bp ladder band while less than 10% of the 80bp band was recovered and no adapter dimers or primers were detectable in the libraries after AMPure cleaning the final PCR.

“I would recommend PAGE purification, it's a small price to pay when considering the cost of Illumina sequencing in both time and $$. I resuspend to 100uM in TE, aliquot, then dilute to 500nM (1:200) for use. This is the standard procedure that Illumina uses for their sequencing primers.” [Brewster Kingham]
