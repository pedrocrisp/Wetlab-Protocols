#Turbo DNase treatment

Maxi TURBO prep for high levels of DNA. 

[Life Tech/ Invitrogen Kit #AM2238](http://www.lifetechnologies.com/order/catalog/product/AM2238?ICID=search-product) 1000U will make 250 rxns (~AUD$187).


1.	Prepare 90uL aliquots of RNA with up to  20 ug nucleic acid

2.	Add DNase
  * Add 10 uL of 10x Turbo DNase buffer (0.1 volume).
  * Add 1.0 uL TURBO DNase (2U).
  * Mix gently with pipette.

|Component|50ul (up to 10ug TNA)| 100ul (up to 20ug TNA)|
|:--|:--:|:--|
|DNA [ug]| < 10ug| < 20ug|
|H<sub>2</sub>O| to 40 | to 90 |
|10x buffer | 5 | 10|
|TURBO DNase| 1.0 | 1.0 | 

3.	Incubate at 37°C for 30 mins

4.	Add another 1.0 ul of DNase and incubate for a further 30 mins.

## RNA recovery: AMPure

### AMPure XP (1.8x) clean:
Add the following to a new non-stick, nuclease-free 0.2 ml PCR tube, strip or plate:
*Note AMPure XP are not guaranteed RNase free...*

|Reagent			|volume	|
|:------------------------------|:------:|
|AMPure XP bead solution	|90 μl	|
|RNA          	|50 μl	|

- Vigorously vortex tube and incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- Place tube in magnetic stand for 5 minutes or until solution clears, to capture the beads. After the suspension is clear, remove and discard supernatant. Do not disturb bead pellet.
- With the tube on the magnetic stand, carefully add 180 μl of 80% EtOH to the bead pellet.
- Lift the tube off the magnetic stand, move it up one row and place it back onto the magnetic stand. Repeat 6 times. Allow the beads to settle. Discard the supernatant.
- With the tube on the magnetic stand, repeat the wash with 180 μl of 80% EtOH. Discard the supernatant. Do not disturb the beads. 
- Open the tube lid and transfer to a 37°C heat block for 3 minutes or until the beads are completely dry. Small cracks can be observed in the dried pellet.
- Add 21 μl (or desired volume + 1 ul) of dH<sub>2</sub>O directly to the pellet and mix thoroughly using a pipette. 
- Incubate for 10 minutes.
- Place the tube in the magnetic stand for at least 2 minute to allow complete capture of the beads. When suspension is clear, transfer 20 ul of the RNA-containing supernatant to a new tube.

## RNA recovery: Phenol:chloroform + precipitation

5.	Add 100 ul of phenol-chloroform, mix by inverting or shaking until thoroughly mixed.

6.	Centrifuge at 14,000g for 10mins at 4°C.

7.	Transfer the upper phase (~100ul) to a fresh tube.

8.	Add 1 volume of cold isopropanol (~100ul) and 1/10 volume of 4M NaOAc, pH 5.2
  * For higher yield and sRNA recovery incubate overnight @ -20°C
  * Alternatively, incubate for 15 mins in -80°C freezer.

9.	Centrifuge samples for 20 mins, max g, at 4°C.  Remove supernatant with pipette.

10.	Rinse the pellet with 900uL of 70% ethanol, invert several times then centrifuge samples for 5 mins, 7,500 x g, at RT.  

11.	Remove EtOH with pipette. Pulse spin and remove remaining EtOH. Air dry 5 ins RT.

12.	Re-suspend in H<sub>2</sub>O or TRIS (eg 20uL).
